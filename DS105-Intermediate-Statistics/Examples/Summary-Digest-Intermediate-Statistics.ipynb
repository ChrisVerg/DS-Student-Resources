That test is called the Welch One-Way Test, and you'll learn about this ANOVA option.\n",

If there's a chance that a participant or an object will fit into more than one level of the IV, than chances are there is a violation of the assumption of independence and a MANOVA should not be run!\n",

    "#### Absence of Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, multicollinearity can be assessed simply by running correlations of the dependent variables with each other. A general rule of thumb is that anything above approximately .7 for correlation (i.e. a strong correlation) indicates the presence of multicollinearity.  Check out the correlation between ```pledged``` and ```backers``` with a simple ```cor.test()``` function: \n",

    "cor.test(kickstarter$pledged, kickstarter$backers, method=\"pearson\", use=\"complete.obs\")\n",
