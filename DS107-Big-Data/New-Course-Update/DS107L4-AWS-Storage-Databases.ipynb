    "You can store virtually as many objects as you want in a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Bucket names are universal, and must be unique across the world. Objects can be up to 5 terabytes in size. By default, data in Amazon S3 is stored redundantly across multiple facilities. The data that you store in Amazon S3 is not associated with any particular server, and you do not need to manage any infrastructure yourself. You can put as many objects into S3 as you want. Amazon S3 holds trillions of objects, and regularly peaks at millions of requests per second. Objects can be almost any data file, such as images, videos, or server logs. You can fine-grained control over who can access you data by using AWS Identity and Access Management policies, Amazon S3 bucket policies, and even per object access control lists. By default, none of your data is shared publicly. You can also encrypt your data in transit and and at rest by enabling server-side encryption. Amazon S3 includes event notifications that enable you to set up automatic notifications when certain events occur, such as when an object is uploaded to a bucket or deleted from a specific bucket. Those notifications can be sent to you, or they can be used to trigger other processes, such as AWS Lambda functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon S3 offers a range of object-level storage classes that are designed for different use cases:\n",
    "- Amazon S3 Standard\n",
    "    - is designed for high availability, high durability, and performance for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, Amazon S3 Standard is appropriate for a variety of use cases, including:\n",
    "        - content distribution and,\n",
    "        - big data analytics.\n",
    "- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 Standard-IA)\n",
    "    - is designed to provide the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 standard, with a low per gigabyte storage prices and per gigabyte retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes this choice good for long-term stroage and backups, and it's a datastore for disaster recovery files.\n",
    "- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 One Zone-IA)\n",
    "    - is for data that is access less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other Aamzon S3 storage classes, which store data in a minimum of three availability zones, this selection stores data in a single availability zone. It costs less than Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access. This works well for customers who want a lower cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the availability and resilience of Amazon S3 Standard or Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access. It is a good choice for storing backup copies or easy to recreate data, like thumbnail version of an image catalog. \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering\n",
    "    - is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost effective tier. For a small monthly fee per object, Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of the objects and moves those objects if the objects haven't been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the standard tier. The Intelligent Tiering storage class works well for long-lived data with access patterns that are unknown or unpredictable. \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Glacier\n",
    "    - is a secure, durable, and low cost storage class for data archiving. To keep costs low, yet suitable for changing needs, Amazon S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from minutes to hours. You can upload objects directly to S3 Glacier, or use Amazon S3 life cycle policies to transfer data between any of the Amazon S3 Storage or Amazon S3 Glacier.   \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive\n",
    "    - is the lowest cost storage class. It supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that might be accesses once or twice a year. It is designed for highly regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare and the public sector. In some cases, these customers need to retain data sets for seven to ten years to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use-cases. It is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage alternative to magnetic tape systems. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive complements Amazon S3 Glacier, and it is also designed for 11 9's of durability. All objects that are stored here are replicated stored in at least three availability zones. These objects can be restored within 12 hours.\n",

You can view access logs for the bucket and its objects. Also, you can choose the geographical region where your S3 stores the bucket and its contents. In the above example, Amazon S3 was used to create a bucket in the Tokyo region, which is identified within AWS formally by its region code, ap-northwest-1. The URL for a bucket is shown by the example above. In this example, you can see the two different ways or styles to access the bucket. The path-style URL endpoint is normally used when you need to access objects. The virtual hosted style URL endpoint is used when you are using your bucket as a website for static data. Notice the difference in structure. In this example, object Preview2.mp4 is stored inside the bucket.\n",

    "When you create a bucket in Amazon S3, it is associated with a specific AWS region. When you store data in the bucket it is redundantly stored across multple AWS facilities within your selected region. This means your data is secure even if there is concurrent data loss in two AWS facilities. Amazon S3 automatically manages the storage for your bucket while your data grows. You can get started immediately, and your data storage will grow with your application needs. Amazon S3 also scales to handle a high volume of requests. You do not need to provision the storage or throughput, and you are billed only for what you use.\n",

    "you can also access Amazon S3 data in your bucket with third party applications and back up tools. Keep in mind, this is considered programmatic access, and will require that you provision an ssh key pair for the tool to access the Amazon S3 service. The endpoints that support HTTP and HTTP access must be globally unique and DNS compliant. This means that bucket names need to be all lowercase, and contain a combination of only letters, numbers and dashes. Symbols such as exclamation points aren't allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility to store a virtually unlimited amount of data, and to access that data from anywhere means that AWS S3 is suitable for a variety of scenarios including static website hosting. Amazon S3 Buckets can serve the static contents of your website. Including HTML, Javascript, CSS and other files. The high durability of Amazon S3 makes it a good candidate for storing backups of your data. For greater availability and disaster recovery capability, Amazon S3 can be configured to support cross-region replication. So that data in an Amazon S3 bucket in one region can be automatically replicated in another region.    \n",

You can mount an Amazon EFS file system on your VPC. Amazon EFS supports Network File System 4.0 and 4.1. You can access your Amazon EFS file system concurrently from multiple Amazon EC2 instances in your VPC.  So, applications that scale beyond a single connection can access a file system. Amazon EC2 instances that run in mutilple availability zones within the same AWS region can access the file system, so many users can access and share a common data source. In the diagram, the VPC has three availability zones, and each availability zone has one mount target that was created in it. Accessing the file system from the mount target within the same availability zone is advised. One of the availability zones has two subnets.

However, only a few operations such as creating and deleting vaults and creating and managing archive policies are available in the console. For other operations and interactions with Amazon S3 Glacier you must use either Amazon S3 Glacier REST APIs, the AWS Java or .NET SDKs, or the AWS CLI.

    "You should automate the lifecycle of the data that you store in Amazon S3. By using lifecycle policies you can cycle data at regular intervals between different Amazon storage types. This automation reduces your overall cost because you pay less for the data as it becomes less important over time. In addition to setting lifecycle rules per object you can also set lifecycle rules per bucket. Consider the example of a lifecycle policy that moves data as it ages from Amazon S3 Standard, to Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access, and finally into Amazon S3 Glacier before it's deleted. Supposed that a user uploads a video to your application and your application generates a thumbnail preview of the video. This video preview is stored to Amazon S3 Standard because it is likely that the user wants to access it right away. Your usage data indicates that most thumbnail previews are not accessed after 30 days. Your lifecycle policy takes these previews and moves them to Amazon Standard - Infrequent Access after 30 days. After another 30 days elapsed, the preview is likely not to be accessed again. The previews move to Amazon Glacier where it remains after 1 year. After one year the preview is deleted. The lifecycle policy manages all this movement automatically.\n",

    "Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class that is associated with it. All the storage classes are designed for 11 nines of durability for objects across multiple Availability Zones, except Amazone S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access, which is in a single Availability Zones. S3 Standard works well in performance-sensitive use-cases and frequently used data. Standard is the default storage class in Amazon S3. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize cost by automatically moving data to the most cost effective access tier without impacting performance or opertational costs. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access is optimized for long-lived and less frequently accessed data. For example, backups and older data that are accessed less frequently, but still require high performance. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access stores data in a single Availability Zone and costs less that S3 Standard-Infrequent Access. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access works well for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard of Standard-Infrequent Access. S3 Glacier is suitable for archiving data, where access is infrequent and a retrieval time of several hours is acceptable. Archived objects are not available for real-time access. They must be restored before they can be accessed. The S3 Glacier storage class is very low cost. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest cost storage solution and supports long-term retention and digital preservation of data that might be accessed once or twice a year. It is designed for customers that must retain data sets for 7 to 10 years or even longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements.   \n",

    "While Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier are both object storage solutions that enable you to store virtually unlimited amounts of data, they have some critical differences between them. The chart above outlines some of these differences. Be careful of which storage solution is correct for your needs. These two services serve very different storage needs. Amazon S3 is designed for frequent low latency access to your data. Amazon S3 Glacier is designed for low-cost long-term storage of infrequently accessed data. Because you get faster access with S3 the storage cost per gigabyte is higher that it is with Glacier. The maximum item size in Amazon S3 is 5 terabytes. Amazon S3 Glacier can store items that are up to 40 terabytes in size. While both services have per request charges, Amazon S3 charges for PUT, COPY, POST, LIST, and GET operations. In contrast, Amazon S3 Glacier charges for upload and retrieval operations. Because Amazon S3 Glacier was designed for less frequent access to data, it costs more for each retrieval request than Amazon S3. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important difference between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier is how data is encrypted. Server-side encryption is focused on protecting data at rest. With both solutions you can securely transfer your data over HTTPS. Any data you archive in Glacier is encrypted by default. With Amazon S3 your application must initiate server-side encryption. There are several ways to enable server-side encryption in Amazon S3. First, you can enable server-side encryption in Amazon S3 with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys, or SSE S3. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard it encrypts the key with a main key that rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES 256, to encrypt your data. Next, you can use server-side encryption with customer provided encryption keys, what is known as SSE-C. This option enables you to set your own encryption keys. You include the encryption key as a part of your request, and Amazon S3 manages both encryption  as it writes to disks and decryption when you access your objects. Finally, you can use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Services, or AWS KMS. AWS KMS is a service that combines secure, highly-available hardware and software to provide a key management system that is scaled for the cloud. AWS KMS uses customer master keys to encrypt your Amazon S3 objects. You access KMS through the encryption section of the AWS IAM Console. You can also access AWS KMS through the API to centrally create encryption keys, define the policies that control how keys can be used, and audit key usage to prove that they are being used correctly.  \n",

First, you can control and enable and control access to your data in Amazon S3 Glacier by using IAM. You set up an IAM policy that specifies user access. Secondly, Glacier encrypts your data by default. You can choose how you want to manage the keys to that encrypted data. \n",

    "AWS solutions typically fall into one of two categories, either unmanaged or managed services.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unmanaged services are typically provisioned as discrete portions as specified by users. As the owner of the service, you manage how the service responds to changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable. If you want to maintain complete control of your database, you can install a relational database management system on an EC2 instance. This will be very similar to running your database in a physical data center that you own, and will be an example of an unmanaged service. Say that you launch a web server on an EC2 instance. Because Amazon EC2 is an unmanaged solution, that web server will not scale automatically to scale to handle increased traffic load or replace unhealthy instances with healthy ones unless you specify that it uses a scaling solution. It could be the auto scaling service that you use. The benefit of using an unmanaged service is that you have more fine-tuned control over how your solution handles changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable. There is also some configuration for managed services. For example, you can create an S3 bucket and set permissions for it. However, managed services typically require a lot less configuration. Now let's look at the challenges or running an unmanaged standalone relational database. Then you can understand how Amazon RDS addresses those challenges.\n",

    "Let's take a closer look at the details of RDS, the basic building blocks of the Amazon RDS is the database instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "A database instance is an isolated database environment that you can contain multiple user created databases. You can access your databases using the same tools and applications that you use with a standalone database instance. When setting up your database, you pick an instance class and the type of storage you need for your database. Database instances and storage differ in performance characteristics and price. This enables you to customize your performance and costs to the needs of your business. When you choose to create a database instance, you specify which database engine to run. Amazon RDS supports six database engines, MySQL, Amazon Aurora, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/Amazon-RDS-VPC.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Amazon RDS VPC\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a VPC you have control over your virtual network environment. You can select your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure routing and access control lists to control access to your database. The basic functionality of Amazon RDS is the same whether or not you run it in a VPC. Usually the database instance is isolated in a private subnet, and it's only made directly accessible to the applications you choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/Amazon-RDS-High-Availability.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Amazon RDS High-Availability\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of Amazon RDS is the ability to configure your database instance for availability with a Multi-AZ deployment. When you configure a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically generates a standby copy of the database instance in another AZ within the same VPC. After seeding the database copy, transactions are synchronously replicated in the standby copy. Running a database instance in a multi AZ deployment can enhance availability during planned system maintenance. And it can help protect your database instance if there is ever a disruption in your AZ. \n",
    "\n",

    "  <img  src=\"Media/Amazon-RDS-High-Availability2.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Amazon RDS High-Availability 2\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the main database instance fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically brings the standby database instance online as the new main instance. The synchronous replication minimizes the potential for data loss. Because your applications reference the database by name using the DNS domain endpoint, you don't need to change anything in your application code to use the standby copy for failover. \n",

Updates that are made to the source database instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica instance. You can reduce the load on your source database instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica. This is a configuration that you would choose if you have an application with a high number of read operations. \n",

    "- A medium to high query or write rate - up to 30,000 IOPS (15,000 reads + 15,000 writes)\n",
    "- No more than a single work node or shard\n",
    "- High durability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do not use Amazon RDS when your application requires:\n",
    "- Massive read/write rates (for example, 150,000 write/second)\n",
    "- Sharding due to high data size or throughput demands\n",
    "- Simple GET or PUT requests and queries that a NoSQL database can handle\n",
    "- Relational Database Management System (RDMS) customization\n",

There is no minimum requirements or commitments.  you can also select reserve instances. With reserve instances you make a one-time upfront payment for each database instance that you want to reserve for one year or a three-year term.

    "With DynamoDB with transition from relational databases to non-relational databases. Let's review the differences between these two types of databases. A relational database works with structured data that is organized by tables records and columns. You can think of tables like a spreadsheet with the rows being the records and the columns being the fields. Relational databases create relationships between tables so you can pull data from multiple tables with queries. Relational databases use structured query language, which is a programming language for interacting with the database. A non-relational database is any database that doesn't follow the relational model. Non-relational databases work with lists of key-value pairs. Look at the two examples of data in the diagram below. \n",

    "  <img  src=\"Media/Amazon-Relational-VS-Non-Relational-DBs.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Amazon Relational vs Non-Relational DBs\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured example is a set of rows and columns while the unstructured example is a list of items stored in a document. Many non-relational databases use JavaScript Object Notation or (JSON) to document your storage data. Non relational databases have grown in popularity because they overcome the limitations of relational databases for handling the demands of semi-structure and unstructured data. Non-relational database scale down horizontally, this makes them a better choice for massive data sets. Non-relational databases are also known as NoSQL databases. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at what DynamoDB is. DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent single-digit millisecond latencies at any scale. Amazon manages all the underlying data structure for this service and redundantly store data across multiple facilities in a region in a fault-tolerant architecture. With DynamoDB you create tables then add items to a table. The system automatically partitions your data and has table storage optimizated for very large and highly volatile data sets. There is no practical limit on the number of items you can store in a table. For instance, some customers have production tables that contain billions of items. One of the benefits of a NoSQL database is that items in the same table can have different attributes. This gives you the flexibility to add attributes as your application evolves. You can store new or format items side-by-side with older format items in the same table without needing to migrate your schema. Migrating a schema in a traditional relational database service, can reduce your ability to respond quickly to changing data requirements. As your application becomes more popular and as users continue to interact with it, your storage can grow with your application needs. All the data in DynamoDB is stored in solid state drives. And it's simple query language enables consistent low latency query performance. In addition to scaling storage with DynamoDB, you can provision the amount of read or write throughput that you need for your table. As the number of application users grow, DynamoDB tables can be scaled to handle the increased number of read, write, requests with manual provisioning. You can also enable automatic scaling so that DynamoDB monitors the load on the table and automatically increases or decreases the provisioned throughput. Some other key DynamoDB features include global tables that enable you to automatically replicate your choice across AWS regions. You can also encrypt your data at rest and set a time to live for specific items. The core DynamoDB components are table items and attributes. A table is a collection of data. Items are a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable. For example, if you had a table for all your friends, every friend would be a distinct item. An attibute is a fundamental data element in the table. For example, if you had a table of friends including their phone numbers, you might have attributes like first name, last name, and phone number. \n",

    "When you create a table in addition to the table name, you must specify a primary key of the table. When you add, update, or delete an item in the table, you must specify the primary key attributes values for that item. DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys. A simple primary key is an attribute that uniquely identifies an item. The attribute is called a partition key. A composite primary key is composed of two attributes. The first attribute is the partition key, and the second attribute is called the sort key.\n",

After a databse crash, Amazon Aurora does not need to replay the redo log from the last database checkpoint, instead it peforms this on every read operation.  This reduces the restart time after a database crash to less than 60 seconds in most cases. The Aurora architecture removes the buffer cache from the database process, that's why the buffer is available immediately after a restart. This means you do not need to throttle access after a crash while you wait for cache to repopulate. "
