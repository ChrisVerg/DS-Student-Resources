    "You can store virtually as many objects as you want in a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Bucket names are universal, and must be unique across the world. Objects can be up to 5 terabytes in size. By default, data in Amazon S3 is stored redundantly across multiple facilities. The data that you store in Amazon S3 is not associated with any particular server, and you do not need to manage any infrastructure yourself. You can put as many objects into S3 as you want. Amazon S3 holds trillions of objects, and regularly peaks at millions of requests per second. Objects can be almost any data file, such as images, videos, or server logs. You can fine-grained control over who can access you data by using AWS Identity and Access Management policies, Amazon S3 bucket policies, and even per object access control lists. By default, none of your data is shared publicly. You can also encrypt your data in transit and and at rest by enabling server-side encryption. Amazon S3 includes event notifications that enable you to set up automatic notifications when certain events occur, such as when an object is uploaded to a bucket or deleted from a specific bucket. Those notifications can be sent to you, or they can be used to trigger other processes, such as AWS Lambda functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon S3 offers a range of object-level storage classes that are designed for different use cases:\n",
    "- Amazon S3 Standard\n",
    "    - is designed for high availability, high durability, and performance for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, Amazon S3 Standard is appropriate for a variety of use cases, including:\n",
    "        - content distribution and,\n",
    "        - big data analytics.\n",
    "- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 Standard-IA)\n",
    "    - is designed to provide the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 standard, with a low per gigabyte storage prices and per gigabyte retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes this choice good for long-term stroage and backups, and it's a datastore for disaster recovery files.\n",
    "- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 One Zone-IA)\n",
    "    - is for data that is access less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other Aamzon S3 storage classes, which store data in a minimum of three availability zones, this selection stores data in a single availability zone. It costs less than Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access. This works well for customers who want a lower cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the availability and resilience of Amazon S3 Standard or Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access. It is a good choice for storing backup copies or easy to recreate data, like thumbnail version of an image catalog. \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering\n",
    "    - is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost effective tier. For a small monthly fee per object, Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of the objects and moves those objects if the objects haven't been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the standard tier. The Intelligent Tiering storage class works well for long-lived data with access patterns that are unknown or unpredictable. \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Glacier\n",
    "    - is a secure, durable, and low cost storage class for data archiving. To keep costs low, yet suitable for changing needs, Amazon S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from minutes to hours. You can upload objects directly to S3 Glacier, or use Amazon S3 life cycle policies to transfer data between any of the Amazon S3 Storage or Amazon S3 Glacier.   \n",
    "- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive\n",
    "    - is the lowest cost storage class. It supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that might be accesses once or twice a year. It is designed for highly regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare and the public sector. In some cases, these customers need to retain data sets for seven to ten years to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use-cases. It is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage alternative to magnetic tape systems. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive complements Amazon S3 Glacier, and it is also designed for 11 9's of durability. All objects that are stored here are replicated stored in at least three availability zones. These objects can be restored within 12 hours.\n",

You can view access logs for the bucket and its objects. Also, you can choose the geographical region where your S3 stores the bucket and its contents. In the above example, Amazon S3 was used to create a bucket in the Tokyo region, which is identified within AWS formally by its region code, ap-northwest-1. The URL for a bucket is shown by the example above. In this example, you can see the two different ways or styles to access the bucket. The path-style URL endpoint is normally used when you need to access objects. The virtual hosted style URL endpoint is used when you are using your bucket as a website for static data. Notice the difference in structure. In this example, object Preview2.mp4 is stored inside the bucket.\n",

    "When you create a bucket in Amazon S3, it is associated with a specific AWS region. When you store data in the bucket it is redundantly stored across multple AWS facilities within your selected region. This means your data is secure even if there is concurrent data loss in two AWS facilities. Amazon S3 automatically manages the storage for your bucket while your data grows. You can get started immediately, and your data storage will grow with your application needs. Amazon S3 also scales to handle a high volume of requests. You do not need to provision the storage or throughput, and you are billed only for what you use.\n",

    "\n",
    "you can also access Amazon S3 data in your bucket with third party applications and back up tools. Keep in mind, this is considered programmatic access, and will require that you provision an ssh key pair for the tool to access the Amazon S3 service. The endpoints that support HTTP and HTTP access must be globally unique and DNS compliant. This means that bucket names need to be all lowercase, and contain a combination of only letters, numbers and dashes. Symbols such as exclamation points aren't allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility to store a virtually unlimited amount of data, and to access that data from anywhere means that AWS S3 is suitable for a variety of scenarios including static website hosting. Amazon S3 Buckets can serve the static contents of your website. Including HTML, Javascript, CSS and other files. The high durability of Amazon S3 makes it a good candidate for storing backups of your data. For greater availability and disaster recovery capability, Amazon S3 can be configured to support cross-region replication. So that data in an Amazon S3 bucket in one region can be automatically replicated in another region.    \n",
