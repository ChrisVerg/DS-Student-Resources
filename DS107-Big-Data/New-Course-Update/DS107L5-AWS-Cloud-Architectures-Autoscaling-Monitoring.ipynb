    "Architecture is the art and science of designing and building large structures. Large systems require architects to manage their size and complexity. What do cloud architects do? Cloud architects engage with decision makers to identify the business goal and the capabilities that need improvement. They ensure alignment between technology deliverables of a solution and the business goals. They work with delivery teams that are implementing the solution to ensure that the technology features are appropriate. The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a guide that is designed to help you build the most secure, high-performing, resilient and efficient infrastructure possible for your cloud applications and workloads. It provides a set of foundational questions and the best practices that can help you evaluate and implement your cloud architectures.

    "    - Annotations can be used as input to your operations as code.\n",
    "- Make frequent small reversible changes \n",

    "    - Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail.\n",
    "- Refine operations procedures frequently\n",
    "    - Here you look for opportunities to improve operations procedures and update them as they evolve.\n",
    "- Anticipate failure\n",
    "    - This is where you identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated.\n",
    "    - Test failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact regularly.\n",

    "- Apply security at all layers\n",
    "    - Here you apply defense-in-depth and apply security controls to all layers of your architecture, for example, edge network, virtual private cloud, subnet, and load balancer, and every instance, operating system, and application.\n",
    "- Automate security best practices\n",
    "    - This is where you automate security mechanisms to improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost effectively.\n",
    "- Protect data in transit and at rest\n",
    "    - Here you classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms such encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.\n",
    "- Keep people away from data\n",
    "    - This is where you reduce the loss or modification of sensitive data due to human error. Create mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "One of the best practices identified in the AWS Well-Architected Framework is to plan for failure, which means application or workload downtime. You need to architect your applications and workloads to withstand failure. There are two important factors that cloud architects consider when designing architectures to withstand failure: reliability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reliability\n",
    "    - A measure of your system's ability to provide functionality when desired by the user.\n",
    "    - System includes all the system components: hardware, firmware, and software.\n",
    "    - Probability that your entire system will function for a specified period.\n",
    "    - Mean time between failures (MTBF) = total time in service/number of failures\n",
    "    \n",
    "To understand reliability, it is helpful to consider the familiar example of a car.\n",

    "  <img  src=\"Media/AWS-Reliability-Car.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"AWS-Reliability-Car\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The car is a system. Each of the cars components, for example, the cooling, ignition, and brakes must work together in order for the car to work properly.  If you try to start the car and ignition fails, you cannot drive anywhere. The car is not available. If the ignition fails repeatedly, your car is not considered reliable. A common way to measure reliability is to use statistical measurements such as mean time between failures, what is commonly referred to as MTBF. MTBF is the total time in service over the number of failures. Let's say you have an application that you bring online Monday at noon.\n",

    "The application is said to be available. It functions normally until it fails Friday at noon. Therefore the time to failure or the length of time the application is available is 96 hours. You spend from Friday at noon until Monday at noon diagnosing why the application failed and repairing it, at which point you bring the application back online. Therefore, the time to repair is 72 hours and you had no weekend. Then it happens again. The application fails on Friday at noon. You spend from Friday until Monday at noon repairing it and you bring it back online Monday at noon. Let's say this failure-repair-restore cycle happens every week and you don't get a weekend. You can now calculate the average of these numbers. In this example, your mean time to failure is 96 hours and your mean time to repair is 72 hours. Your mean time between failures is 168 hours or one week, which is the sum of the other mean time to failure and the mean time to repair. As you just learned, failure of system components impacts the availability of the system. Formally, availability is the percentage of time that a system is operating normally or correctly performing the operations of it or normal operation time over total time. Availability is reduced any time an application isn't operating normally including both scheduled and unscheduled interruptions. \n",

    "A highly available system can be viewed as a set of system-wide shared resources that cooperate to guarantee essential services. High availability combines software with open standard hardware to minimize downtime by quickly restoring essential services when a system component or application fails. Services are restored rapidly, often less than one minute. Availability requirements may vary. The length of disruption that is acceptable depends on the type of application. Take a moment and study the common application availability design goals and the maximum length of disruption that can occur within a year while still meeting the goal. \n",

You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol, like HTTP, and a port number, such as port 80. Similarly, it is configured with a protocol and a port number for connections from the load balancers to the targets. You can also configure your load balancer to perform health checks, which are used to monitor health of the registered targets so that the load balancer only sends requests to the healthy instances. When the load balancer detects a unhealthy target, it stops routing requests to that target. It then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.\n",
