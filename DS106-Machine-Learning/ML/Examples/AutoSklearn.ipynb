    "[Auto-Sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) is an open-source library for performing AutoML in Python. It makes use of the popular Scikit-Learn machine learning library for data transforms and machine learning algorithms and uses a [Bayesian Optimization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-bayesian-optimization/) search procedure to efficiently discover a top-performing model pipeline for a given dataset.\n",

    "AutoML With Auto-Sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Machine Learning, or AutoML for short, is a process of discovering the best-performing pipeline of data transforms, model, and model configuration for a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML often involves the use of sophisticated optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian Optimization, to efficiently navigate the space of possible models and model configurations and quickly discover what works well for a given predictive modeling task. It allows non-expert machine learning practitioners to quickly and easily discover what works well or even best for a given dataset with very little technical background or direct input.\n",

    "[Auto-Sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) is an open-source Python library for AutoML using machine learning models from the scikit-learn machine learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was developed by [Matthias Feurer](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/feurer/index.html), et al. and described in their 2015 paper titled “Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "… we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters).\n",

    "— [Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning, 2015](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5872-efficient-and-robust-automated-machine-learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of Auto-Sklearn is that, in addition to discovering the data preparation and model that performs for a dataset, it also is able to learn from models that performed well on similar datasets and is able to automatically create an ensemble of top-performing models discovered as part of the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system, which we dub AUTO-SKLEARN, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization.\n",
