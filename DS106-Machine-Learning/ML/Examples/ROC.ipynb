    "# Area Under ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC metrics are only suitable for binary classification problems (e.g. two classes). To calculate ROC information, you must change the summary Function in your train Control to be two Class Summary. This will calculate the Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) also called just Area Under Curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. ROC is actually the area under the ROC curve or AUC. The AUC represents a model’s ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. An area of 1.0 represents a model that predicts perfectly. An area of 0.5 represents a model as good as random.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitivity is the true positive rate also called the recall. It is the number of instances from the positive (first) class that actually predicted correctly.\n",
    "- Specificity is also called the true negative rate. It is the number of instances from the negative class (second class) that were actually predicted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC can be broken down into sensitivity and specificity. A binary classification problem is really a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity."
