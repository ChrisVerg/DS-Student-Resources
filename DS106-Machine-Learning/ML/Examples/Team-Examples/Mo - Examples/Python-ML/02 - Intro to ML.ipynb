The program would then take in the data and calculate your profits or loss based on your sales and payroll records.  In this case, the output is the profit/loss statement, as well as other charts."

Instead of feeding the data to the program, you now use the data and the output that you have collected to derive your program (also known as the model). Using the same financial example, with the machine learning paradigm, you would take the detailed financial records (which are collectively both the data and output) and use them to derive a set of rules to make predictions."
