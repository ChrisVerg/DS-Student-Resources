    "## Why does chardet report a utf-8 file as ascii\n",
    "chardet is a python library that is used to detect the encoding of a file. It does this by analyzing the byte patterns in the file and comparing them to known patterns for various encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, which means that it can use one to four bytes to represent a single character. ASCII, on the other hand, uses one byte per character. If a file is saved in UTF-8 format, but only contains characters that can be represented using the ASCII character set, then chardet may incorrectly report the encoding as ASCII because the byte patterns in the file match the patterns for ASCII more closely than those for UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the file may be in UTF-8 but since it's only using the ASCII subset of the UTF-8 encoding, it can't be distinguished from ASCII by chardet, as it doesn't have enough information."

    "## Is US-ASCII same as UTF-8?\n",
    "For characters represented by the 7-bit ASCII character codes, the UTF-8 representation is exactly equivalent to ASCII, allowing transparent round trip migration. Other Unicode characters are represented in UTF-8 by sequences of up to 6 bytes, though most Western European characters require only 2 bytes.\n"
