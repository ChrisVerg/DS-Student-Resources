    "What is a package manager?\n",
    "Package managers are programs which install, update, and remove software. Doing these operations by hand would be tedious and prone to mistakes. Bundling these functionalities into a single tool gives users a more streamlined experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "YUM has even more utility because it performs dependency resolution whenever it installs, removes, or updates software. The upcoming steps will give examples of how to use YUM to streamline your package management.\n",

    "Installing a package with yum\n",
    "Install the network analysis application Wireshark using yum. This application is useful for troubleshooting network packets that are traveling in and out of your system. This functionality in particular is not important to this lab, this application was picked simply because it serves as a good test subject for the upcoming examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "yum install -y wireshark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The -y option will automatically answer yes to any prompts during the installation. Using this option is not best practice when installing software on your own system, but it is useful for streamlining some operations in this lab.\n",

    "This installation generates a large output, so here is a high level summary of what each section means. The first section shows all of the packages that must be installed as dependencies for Wireshark:\n",
