    "What are file permissions? File permissions determine which users can operate on files on a system. These operations are broken down into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read: Viewing the contents of a file\n",
    "- Write: Changing the contents of a file\n",
    "- Execute: Running contents of a file as code\n",
    "- Permissions function differently when applied to directories. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read allows users to view the contents of a directory, \n",
    "2. write allows users to add and delete files, and \n",
    "3. execute allows users to cd into that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: There are three more permissions on top of the ones explained above: setuid, setgid, and sticky bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are file permissions?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to properly assign permissions to files and directories created on a shared system so that files are not accidentally (or maliciously) tampered with, destroyed, or executed. The next section shows you how to view the permissions of files in an example directory.\n",

    "Displaying files and their permissions\n",

    "The command ls -l can be used to look at the permissions associated with each file in the directory. The output for this can be cryptic at first, so this step will walk you through what each character means. Take a look at the contents of the current directory. Use the long listing option (-l) to display information about permissions for each item.\n",

Users in the group that owns this file have r-x, so they can read and execute but cannot write to this file. Finally, all other users have no permissions, ---, so they are unable to read, write, or execute this file.\n",

    "The chmod command is how you modify the permissions associated with files and directories. The chmod command has two different ways to modify permissions: symbolic and absolute. Symbolic permissions have the same format as the access mode output of ls -l. In this mode, you use the characters r, w, and x to set the read, write, and execute permissions. The other mode, absolute, instead uses a series of three numbers to correspond to the permissions for the owner, group, and others. These numbers are identical in meaning to the symbolic mode breakdown, they are just more compact and therefore quicker to type. Here is an example of how the two modes relate from Boolean World:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/Chmod.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"chmod\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This image refers to absolute mode as numeric mode. These two terms are interchangeable and you will commonly see both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial takeaway is that each character in a symbolic permission can be converted to a binary number, 1 if the user has that permission and 0 if the user does not. These three binary numbers become a single octal digit, and three such octal digits compose an absolute representation of the file's permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing permissions (symbolic)\n",
    "In this step, you will be modifying the permissions on the status.sh script using symbolic syntax with the chmod command. In the previous step, you were unable to execute status.sh as rhel. To change that, use the chmod command. The plus (+) operator will add any permissions that you specify, but it will not change any permissions that you do not explicitly set in the command. So in this case, it will give others read and execute access, but will not change the value of write access for the group. Return to the root terminal to execute this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod o+rx status.sh\n",
    "```\n",

    "Verify that this command succeeded using ls -l, specifying that you want to only look at status.sh.\n",

    "-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  66 Jun  2 22:42 status.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Just as o+rx added read and execute permissions for others, chmod accepts the - argument to take away permissions. For example, o-w would remove write privileges from others while leaving the read and execute values untouched. The = argument can be used to explicitly set all permissions symbolically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the guest user will be able to read and execute status.sh. Switch back to the guest terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "su - guest\n",

    "Symbolic mode is the more expanded permissions format which can appeal to newer users. However, the absolute mode described in the next step can save on keystrokes if you take the time to familiarize yourself with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your next goal is to modify the permissions on status.sh to keep full access for the owner and group members, but prevent anyone else from writing to or executing the file. You can do this with three numbers if you use the absolute syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number you would use to do this with chmod is 774. The image below explains how the absolute permission of 774 relates to the access mode string that is output by ls -l.\n",

    "cat: tasks.txt: Permission denied\n",
    "```\n",

    "chown guest tasks.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "cat tasks.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth column of the ls -l output is the group which owns the file. The next step will walk you through changing group ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing group ownership can be much more efficient than manually assigning owners, when there are many users that should have the same access to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing Group Ownership\n",
    "Group ownership can be changed with the chgrp command by adding a colon before the name of the group. Return to the root terminal to execute this command:\n",

    "chown :team tasks.txt\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This change is reflected in the fourth column of the ls -l output, which now says team instead of root.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Some people prefer the chgrp command for changing groups as it has identical syntax to chown, you do not have to add a colon when using chgrp. Others prefer to use chown with the colon as above so that they do not have to remember two different commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in this lab will walk you through using find to locate any files that may have their permissions configured incorrectly.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Auditing permissions\n",
    "The -perm option causes the find command to look at the access modes for each file. In this case you are calling find without a path, which means it will start looking in the current directory. First, check for files that have the permission level 755.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a situation where you have determined that any permissions above a certain level could pose a security issue. Adding a dash before the permission tells the find command to return anything with a permission greater than or equal to the one you are searching for.\n",

    "\n",
    "Running the chmod command with a level of 600 ensures that these files are readable and writable by the owner, but others cannot access them. Instead of running chmod individually on each file, you can use the find command to execute this permission change on any file that exceeds a certain permission level. The -type f option only targets files, so the directory permissions will remain unchanged. The {} \\; at the end of the command is telling find to execute the chmod command separately on each file that matches the search criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "NOTE: You may be tempted to use chmod with the recursive option (-R) to make this change instead of using find. The chmod -R command modifies subdirectories as well as files, however. Since you are removing execute permissions, using chmod recursively would lead to a situation where you could not cd into any of the subdirectories that you just modified. This would also prevent you from running any recursive operations to fix this issue, and you would have to manually change the permissions on each subdirectory individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to double check your work when using the find to execute chmod, as running this command on the wrong directory could lock users out of all of their files."
